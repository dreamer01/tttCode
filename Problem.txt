Design and build the following: 
1. A front end which accepts a number input N with a Submit button (extra points for building frontend in Angular or React or a HTML5 framework)

2. On entering a value and pressing submit, a request should be sent to the backend (backend can be in any technology, extra points for using nodejs)

3. From the backend, fetch a file hosted at http://terriblytinytales.com/test.txt

4. From the backend, return the top N most frequently occurring words in this file (do not use a ready made module for frequency computation)

5. Display the top N words and their frequency of occurrence in the frontend, in a tabular format

Expected solution: 
1. The source code of the frontend and backend to be uploaded to github along with a readme file. Please submit the github link as part of Application Note.

2. Readme must 
- explain components of the code 
- mention all libraries and plugins used (do not use a ready made module for frequency computation) 
- list all test cases run along with test data and screenshots

3. Extra points for hosting this solution on AWS (free tier) or Heroku or somewhere online
